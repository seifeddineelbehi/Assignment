### ðŸ“² Initial Setup

When you open the app for the first time, you will be automatically redirected to the **Accessibility settings**.

To enable full functionalityâ€”specifically the **call hang-up feature**â€”you must:

1. Find the app under **Installed Apps** in the Accessibility menu (e.g., "Assignment App").
2. Tap on it and **enable Accessibility permission**.

This permission is required for the app to detect and handle call termination events.
